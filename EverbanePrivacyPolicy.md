# Privacy Policy of Everbane

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (saved data or in-game settings) created by the the user is stored locally in your device, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No personal information is being read nor received by any means through this app.

The only data this app retrieves is:

The saved game, saved in a .txt file, and the playerprefs.ini file, which is the settings for the game player itself, autogenerated by the Unity engine player.
The dimensions of the device's screen to calculate the scale and position of the User Interface inside the game.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Ed Grace. edgargn1399@gmail.com
