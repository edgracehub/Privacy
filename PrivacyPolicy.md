# Privacy Policy

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (saved data or in-game settings) created by the the user is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either. No personal information is being read nor received by any means through this app.

The only data this app retrieves is the local date and time when the game was saved (it saves automatically every 10 seconds), which is used later to calculate the in-game benefits you get after spending a long time without playing (this is an idle game and you get more rewards the longer you don't play).

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Ed Grace.
