# Privacy Policy of IdleTale

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information besides the player's game data, which is stored in the Unity Cloud Service as a text file identified by a generated player ID inside the Unity Cloud Service. All data (saved data or in-game settings) created by the the user is stored locally in your device with the possibility to be updated to the Unity Cloud Service for multi-devide purposes, and the local data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No personal information is being read nor received by any means through this app other than the creation date of the account, its last login to the Unity Cloud Service or the account used to link to the Unity Player Accounts server.

The only data this app retrieves is:
1. The local date and time when the game was saved (it saves automatically every few seconds, on quit and when put in the background), which is used later to calculate the in-game benefits you get after spending a long time without playing (this is an idle game and you get more rewards the longer you don't play).
2. The API from http//worldtimeapi.org (http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip) used to calculate offline rewards and check if the player had its Internet connection enabled or disabled, which determines if they can receive offline gains or not to prevent time cheating. Used in-app and for the time of the saved data.
3. The app retrieves the current game's version through reading the text in this GitHub file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgracehub/Privacy/main/version.
4. The app retrieves the text for the "News" section found in the title screen through reading the text in this GitHub file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgracehub/Privacy/main/news.
5. The player's data stored in the Unity Cloud Service as a part of the Cloud Saving system.
6. The dimensions of the device's screen to calculate the scale and position of the User Interface inside the game.

To request an account deletion or data deletion from the Unity Cloud Service integrated with IdleTale, please send an e-mail to the email address stated at the bottom of this document including your Player ID (found in the Settings menu inside the game after logging in).

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Ed Grace.
